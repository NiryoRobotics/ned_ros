Getting Started
=========================================

The Niryo ROS Stack can be installed in multiple target OS:

- Raspberry Pi 4
- Desktop

As the stack is based on ROS Noetic, you need to be on an Ubuntu 20.04 based system.

You can either install it directly on an Ubuntu 20.04 or deploy it using `docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_.
