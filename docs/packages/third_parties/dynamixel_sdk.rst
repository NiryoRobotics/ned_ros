Dynamixel SDK package
===================================

This package has been forked from the `official dynamixel_sdk package <https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK/>`_.

It has been adapted to work on Ned's custom Raspberry Pi 4B shield, using the `wiringPi library <http://wiringpi.com/>`_.
