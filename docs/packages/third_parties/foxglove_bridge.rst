Foxglove bridge package
===================================

This package has been forked from the `official foxglove_bridge package <https://github.com/foxglove/ros-foxglove-bridge/>`_ developed by `Foxglove <https://foxglove.dev/>`_.

It is extensively used in the Niryo Robotics stack to communicate with Niryo Studio or the Foxglove Studio application.
