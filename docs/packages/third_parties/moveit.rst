MoveIt! package
=========================================

`MoveIt! <https://github.com/moveit/moveit/>`_ is an advanced motion planning framework used in robotic systems, particularly for controlling robot arms. It is a key tool in the ROS ecosystem, providing capabilities to plan, simulate, and execute complex robotic motions.

Niryo robots rely heavily on this framework to execute the following operations:

1. **Motion Planning**:
   MoveIt! enables the robot arm to compute collision-free paths for reaching target positions.

2. **Kinematics and Dynamics**:
   MoveIt! solves inverse kinematics (IK) and forward kinematics (FK) for precise motion control of the robot arm.

3. **Integration with ROS**:
   MoveIt! seamlessly integrates with ROS topics, services, and action servers, making it easy to control our robot via ROS nodes.

You can follow tutorials about using Moveit! with ROS Noetic `here <https://moveit.github.io/moveit_tutorials/>`_.
