v5.4.0
-----------
**Features**

**Improvements**
  * Brand new modbus server
  * New ros_wrapper functions: get_current_tool_state, get_tcp, get_digital_io_mode, get_available_disk_size, get_ros_logs_size, control_video_stream
  * New system_api_client endpoint: get_system_version_current

**Bugfixes**
  * in ros_wrapper, __conveyor_id_to_conveyor_number no longer rely on the currently attached conveyors

v5.2.2
___________

  * The service /niryo_robot/kinematics/forward now returns status and message in its response
  * The service /niryo_robot/kinematics/inverse now returns status and message in its response

**Bugfixes**
  * Fixed the service /niryo_robot/kinematics/forward which sometimes crashed because of transform extrapolation

v5.2.1
___________
**Features**

**Improvements**

**Bugfixes**
  * the service set_program_autorun wasn't taking the mode into account when passing "DISABLE"

v5.2.0
___________
**Features**
 * Added a foxglove bridge server
 * new messages: BasicObject and BasicObjectList
 * New topics:
   * /niryo_robot_arm_commander/trajectory_list (BasicObjectArray)
   * /niryo_robot_poses_handler/pose_list (BasicObjectArray)
   * /niryo_robot_poses_handler/dynamic_frame_list (BasicObjectArray)
 * New topic: /niryo_robot_poses_handlers/relative_pose
   * This topic publish the TCP pose relative to a dynamic frame
 * New service: /niryo_robot_poses_handlers/set_relative_transform_frame

 * New service: /niryo_robot_database/get_db_file_path
   * Use this service to retrieve the database file path

**Improvements**
 * Refacto of the programs manager
   * It now uses programs ids to handle the programs
   * A program is now defined as a python program which can have a blockly program attached
   * An action server is used to execute a program rather than a service
   * The autorun and the programs properties are stored in the database
   * Named programs_manager_v2 in order to keep the old programs manager for NS1
 * The service GetNameDescription takes an array of BasicObject (for future compatibility)
 * remove ros_wrapper_2

 * modified service type:
   * /niryo_robot/tools/reboot
     * std_srvs/Trigger -> niryo_robot_msgs/Trigger

v5.1.3
___________
**Features**

**Improvements**
 * Added a field "saved_at" in the service /niryo_robot_programs_manager/get_program response
**Bugfixes**


v5.1.2
___________
**Features**

**Improvements**
 * The daily reports can now send metrics about the robot. Currently, the total lifetime of the robot is sent
**Bugfixes**


v5.1.1
___________

**Features**

**Improvements**
 * Revamped WiFi button functionalities: Brief press (< 2s) toggles hotspot; Extended press (> 2s) enables/disables WiFi client; Long press (> 7s) restores network settings. To abort, press for over 10 seconds.
 * WiFi button press triggers LED ring indication for forthcoming action.
 * The database node use the system software HTTP API to get and set the settings in the database. This is to ensure there is only one access point to the database.
 * Reduced the grippers open / close torque to slow down the motor's heating

**Bugfixes**
 * Resolved an issue where the hotspot failed to initiate concurrently with the WiFi client.
 * Fixed a bug that consistently disregarded the "purge ros logs on startup" command.
 * Fixed a problem that sometimes stopped the camera from recognizing colored shapes.
 * Fixed an issue that permitted editing of dynamic frames belonging to workspaces.
 * Rectified dynamic frame editing by implementing quaternion normalization.
 * Fixed a bug that caused the vision picks to catch objects by their corners.


v5.1.0
___________

**Features**

* The topic ``/niryo_robot_tools_commander/tcp`` now return the tcp position either if it is enabled or not
* Every part of a dynamic frame can now be edited using the service ``/niryo_robot_poses_handlers/manage_dynamic_frame``
* Manage a file in ``~/.ros/logs`` which store the date corresponding to the ros run ids
**Improvements**

**Bugfixes**

v5.0.1

**Features**
**Improvements**

**Bugfixes**
* Fixed a bug preventing the downloaded update to be applied successfully
